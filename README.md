# Monthly_GDP_Colab
UK GDP Analysis
This repository contains a data processing and analysis project focused on the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data. The project ingests, cleans, transforms, and analyzes monthly GDP data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and calculates the monthly growth rates. This data can be used to derive insights about the UK's economic performance over time.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:

Ingest GDP data from the ONS website in CSV format.
Clean and transform the data by removing metadata and non-relevant information.
Calculate the growth rate of the UK's GDP on a monthly basis.
Visualize the GDP data and growth rate to identify trends and fluctuations.
Export the cleaned and processed data for further analysis or reporting.
Data Sources
The data is sourced from the ONS Monthly GDP dataset. The dataset provides an index of the UK's GDP from January 2007 to September 2024.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: The raw GDP dataset contains metadata and irrelevant information, which is filtered out during preprocessing.
Growth Rate Calculation: The monthly GDP growth rate is calculated using percentage change.
Data Visualization: Graphs are generated to visualize both the GDP index and the growth rate over time.
Export: The cleaned and processed data is exported into a CSV file for future use.
